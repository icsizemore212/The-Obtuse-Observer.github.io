        <h3>Welcome to My Cognition</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As far back as my identity reaches,
          probably somewhere around the prepubescent stage, I have gained
          satisfaction in the process of observing and analyzing the world and
          my place within it. I have always had an appetite to
          observe and analyze, to find the 
          order
          and purpose among the chaos. My mind is rarely resting, always ruminating, always growing
          closer to some elusive conclusion on purpose and the ideal life. But it
          always ends in paradox, in contradiction, the logical mind can only
          take me so far. Let us see exactly how far that goes. Here you will
          find my thoughts on the human condition, from my point of view. I 
          will
          post stories from my past, personal/spiritual anecdotes, and
          hopefully, yet doubtfully, some manner of wisdom and truth I've
          attained from fusing objective reality with my own subjective
          experience.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am 29 years old and I have made my life very rough. I am a recovering alcoholic but I have a nasty habit of
          having one foot in recovery and one foot in self-destruction. It is
          my diseased and scrupulous thinking that has led me to implicitly seek oblivion
          via drugs and alcohol. This is a place for me to accommodate, 
          express,
          and expunge my incessant thoughts and observations.

        <h3>Excerpt</h3>
        <p>
          Whenever I pick up the bottle or some other punishing substance, I am set on the path of destruction and the ones I care for most are on the front lines doing damage control. Addiction is a selfish storm of relentless strength, some perverted force of nature that human powers have little hope of combatting. This deadly cyclone can not often be thwarted by any human effort, no matter how sincere and desperate. The only option one has when such a storm is on their doorstep is to take cover and either assist in disaster recovery post mayhem, relying on some higher power to prevent another catastrophe, or to move far away where the climate is less familiar and less likely to bring tragedy. Once the toxins in my system subside I am left to absorb the reciprocated energy of my actions. Only then do I witness the debris of my own demolition, with those I love dispersed among the rubble. This heinous vibrancy my mind and body can barely withstand, as the morning after my brain has become a barren wasteland, treated as a rich mine of dopamine now depleted by a horde of substances working as greedy excavators, leaving my neural receptors as dry as a desert plain.


          Thus the cycle continues and the source of my misery beckons, its taunts of instant gratification and temporary relief ring loudly in my ears; soon followed by justification to indulge, and off I go again, lost to the whirlpool of chemical delusion and chaos, not knowing when it will spit me out. It seems as if all of the desperate repentance Iâ€™ve gone through in my life never enacted any change.  As I impatiently waited for my supplier to arrive, I realized I was coming to the end of the longest flood of substance abuse and self-loathing I have ever endured. I just had to ride one more wave of this unabating hurricane, one final tsunami to end the storm, one last time. I have had hundreds of one last times in my life.

          I refuse to believe that my selfish and reckless choices, which have resulted in my own personal turmoil as well as an emotional and financial burden to my family, serve no higher purpose. The wrecking ball of addiction which has demolished my family's serenity and my sense of purpose will ultimately allow a new, more solid foundation to be laid and the finished architecture will be all the more triumphant and beautiful. Many who are successful in achieving greatness are driven by a dark anomaly in their being. They often must first face and overcome their affliction to fulfill their destiny, usually after it has wreaked havoc in their life and those surrounding them. As nerdy as this is about to sound, Anakin Skywalker was gifted with great ability beyond any other jedi, yet he fell victim to the dark side. He terrorized the galaxy before the force of love conquered the darkness within him, redeeming himself and fulfilling his destiny and the prophecy, giving love the final word.

          A deep darkness is almost always heavily associated with a bright light, terrible evil sleeps alongside joyous love. The darkest and brightest moment in Christian theology is the crucifixion of Christ, with the coming resurrection lying dormant amidst the Messiah's suffering; even as dark and sinister energy permeated the savior and perhaps the whole world as he died upon the cross, the purest form of love, sacrificial and unconditional, emanated from his suffering, redeeming all of mankind. The deeper the darkness, the brighter the light. The dualistic nature of existence rings true, love and fear, good and evil, atomic attraction and repulsion consult with one another resulting in the chaos of the cosmos. In reality the dividing line is an illusion and blurred within the quantum field as oneness and unity are felt during mystical experiences and deep states of meditation and prayer where one can become no one, in no place, at no time, pure consciousness. This is a paradox, entering a state of nothingness and yet fullness, with no identity, just awareness, God-consciousness.

          I hope and pray with all of my being, a dire inner desire, that my story will embody the stories and epic tales I have been absorbing my whole life and will lead to a glorious redemption; a victory in love. A victory abundant in tearful joy that belongs to my family as much as it belongs to myself and God. The degree of joy that will permeate our lives as a result of this redemption will be equal to the degree of darkness and turmoil I've caused, or perhaps even greater. I hope my spiritual death has already occurred and my resurrection has begun within these walls I now inhabit. With the right set of eyes you might even be able to see my descent into darkness as necessary. When my spiritual trajectory is viewed from a broader scope, the descent is actually the beginning of my ascension to the peak where trauma meets transcendence.
