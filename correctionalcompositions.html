      <h3>Journal Entry 1-March 16th, 2023, Day 14 </h3>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Since I'm starting these entries on the 14th day of my incarceration, I'd like to give a recap of the night before my report date on March 3rd, which was the first night of my inhabitance in this lovely establishment. Due to this late start, most if not all of these entries will be in the past tense until I catch up to the present day, which may never occur. I never woke up on that Friday, March 3rd, because I never went to sleep. I had been up all night drinking clear Bacardi rum and smoking copious amounts of crack cocaine. I was indulging with some circumstance friends that night in a neighborhood where a white, middle-class, suburban Christian-raised individual like me had no place being. I refer to them as circumstance friends because I only keep their company in certain circumstances, specifically the circumstance of getting to artificially high places by means of substance consumption in various forms, with the addition of my life being in shambles in most of these occurrences.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Amanda and T are the individuals I was with that particular night. Similar to the community of recovery from alcohol and drug addiction, last names are omitted for the sake of anonymity. The recovery and substance-using communities have more in common than one would originally believe. Anonymity and privacy are customary in both, they both have a single requirement for membership, and both unite under a single, established goal. They both strive for spiritual experiences, albeit with opposing directions and different destinations. Those in recovery strive to abide in heaven and those who consume substances have a similar goal of attaining bliss, but they often end up in a hell of their own making. However, very few aspects of existence are black and white. There are certainly those whose consumption habit is not the controlling aspect of their life. The odds vary depending on the substance being used, few master the use of crack cocaine. It generally becomes the master. Most who smoke crack don't come back. Despite the similarities in the recovery and substance use communities, they remain to be the exact opposite, more evidence of dualism and its embodiment in the physical maelstrom of existence, two sides of the same coin. This is the coincidence of opposites, the constant paradox manifested in all reality, the interplay of the positive and negative charge. As humans we exist in the middle, swaying to either side, like the great pendulum of space-time, constantly ticking.    
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I do apologize for that ranting tangent, I do that often. Returning to my circumstance friends Amanda and T; out of all the environments I've consumed drugs, T's home was one of the more comfortable and I had just met him a few days prior. Those in the recovery community would claim they are not my friends at all. In general, I would refute that statement, it isn't that simple, relationships aren't that simple, life isn't that simple, and as stated, is rarely black and white. Among all the users who accompanied me during my use T and Amanda were some of the least selfish and most reserved in their addiction. T managed to keep a roof over his head and food consistently in his stomach. The word functioning comes to mind when describing T's addictive demeanor. Both Amanda and T rarely asked for a dose from my own rock and when they scored their own they returned the favor even though their stash was lighter than mine, honorable dosers they were. It is certainly common for a drug addict to put their demanding habit ahead of their friend’s or family's well-being, but that doesn't inherently equate to a complete void of care for those people on their part, nor does it automatically result in the user being numb to the pain or damage they cause in the lives of others. Everyone needs friends, including crackheads. After all, Amanda and T were both consuming the same substance I was, our habit was already cemented in our lives. It would take quite the self-righteous crackhead to smack a pipe out of someone's hands and then proceed to sit back down and hit their own. We were all individual adults making a conscious decision to use and I would consider them friends. To some degree, they care for me and enjoy my company and I share the same attitude towards them. Although it's true that if I were to try and remain clean I probably wouldn't seek out their presence unless we shared that intention.  
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our supply of dopamine-inducing chemicals was promising for the amount of time I planned on spending at T's. I had spent a one hundred dollar cash advance and traded two cartons of Newport cigarettes for my portion plus whatever Amanda and T bought, plus several liquor drinks. All of this kept us afloat on a magic carpet of dopamine throughout the night and into the early morning. During the session there was a good measure of openness and seemingly honest conversation; this I preferred over the usual activity I participated in among most of the company I kept while drinking and using which consisted of watching gangster rap music videos, which I can't much relate to, and shallow discussion involving egoic praises and false vows of future productivity. That night we discussed our dreams, our pasts, and what's been holding us back. To no grand shock drug use was our main limiting factor. Even T, functioning as he is, admitted to this stubborn truth. He expressed accomplishments he still wished to achieve in the remainder of his life. I assumed he was in his late forties or early fifties, considerably older than Amanda and myself. I don't consider that to be an old age, especially with the acceleration of scientific inquiry and the surfacing of the longevity escape velocity. He admitted crack is holding him back. I suppose most crack addicts are willing to comply with this as it's difficult to uphold the illusion that an extremely addictive substance doesn't come without consequences. It is crack after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is still curious to observe T admit that the exact substance serving as a catalyst for our honest and open discussion with a near stranger (I had only met him that night but considered him a new friend) is also his main restraint to obtaining his most ideal future. Some addicts tend to readily admit their addiction issue, or any core issue of their lives, when they are under the influence of the substance they are addicted to, but this isn't an exact science. During our elevated state, we sometimes succumb to the illusion of prolonged contentment; that somehow, the current state of substance-induced consciousness will be permanently satisfying and we become inspired and commit to new ways of being which will lead to achieving our greatness which tends to include sobriety or controlled use. However, as soon as we return to normalcy the inspiration subsides and the brain's incessant need to return to its dopamine-enriched state creeps from the conditioned subconscious to the forefront of our conscious thought. Our former oath to change takes a backseat to our deceitful master, the puppeteer of our chemical dependence.  
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That night, as our source of chemical relief dwindled, I aimed to save a portion for my home. My room in my parent's house is my favorite place to drink and use, as disrespectful as it is, it is my comfort zone. It's where I feel most at peace, as if the seemingly unconditional love my parents have for me casts an aura around the home; shielding me from the dark energies that result from my foolhardy actions and the harsh consequences of the world outside. Ignorance becomes bliss as I fade into my own dimension. I ordered an Uber to return home around 4:00 A.M. I said goodbye to T, thanked him for the hospitality, and told him I'd see him in a few months after my jail sentence was served; I have my doubts that I'll see him again if I am to remain sober after my release. Amanda came with me to see where I grew up and how I spent my time in solitude before I was to say farewell for a few months or perhaps for good. I knew my parents would object to an unknown visitor accompanying me home on my return trip from one of the many devious and unscrupulous venues I was accustomed to visiting in the ominous hours of the night when I was lost bingeing and giving into the demands of my addiction. With the degree of selfishness I inhabit while on one of these binges, it should be no surprise that I returned home with her anyway.

         <h3>Journal Entry 2-March 19th, 2023, Day 17</h3>
         <p>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Continuing where I left off from the last entry, Amanda and I arrived at my parent's home between four and five in the morning. As expected, my mother answered my phone call and came to let me in while Amanda remained hidden in front of the garage, out of sight. Once my mother returned to bed I quietly ushered Amanda in and up to my room. At last, I was in my room with a fair amount of doses left and of course, the rest of the Bacardi; accompanied by access to my television and the most comforting of digital media distractions; Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video, the works.
         </p>
         <p>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As I mentioned in the previous entry, drinking and using in the privacy of my room is probably my favorite environment to do so. Although I was glad to have some brief company for a change, to have a guest in my domain instead of constantly in someone else's. Specifically, in the comfort of my room, I enjoy watching movies, television, and listening to music while under heavy influence, primarily of alcohol. I also mentioned in my last entry that users and drinkers, in a sense, strive for spiritual experiences when they indulge; assuming one can adopt a liberal definition of spiritual experience. I won't attempt to give my full interpretation of the word spiritual here, considering by the time I get out of jail and post this entry my understanding of spirituality will have changed. I grant it many definitions and allow it to cover a broad spectrum of phenomena. 
         </p>
         <p>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I consider any experience that elicits raw, intense emotion, spiritual. During these intimate moments, one's brain moves from a normal functioning state of consciousness to a more intense state of conscious activity and awareness, with a wide emotional range, including no emotion at all, depending on the flavor of the experience and if it was induced from external stimuli. I'm sure various neurotransmitters, most of which I don't know the name of, flood the brain during these experiences, resulting in an altered state of consciousness. I also believe the stimulus that causes this change must be considered for the experience to be deemed spiritual. The raw unleashing of dopamine via the intake of a substance is one I would not generally consider spiritual, as the dominion and power of the flesh are in full effect. Connection with other human beings or experiencing various forms of art, which in turn elicit states of intense emotion, clarity, insight, or realization, are to me, spiritual moments. During these moments the consciousness is operating on a higher frequency of wavelength, more in tune with the cosmic force of love and meaning, which is the destined purpose behind our evolved state of mind. Changes in one's will, perspective, and behavior can result from these spiritual instances; one's spirit is moved into action; one's world dogma is often changed, at least for the moment, until the elusive curtain of the material world is drawn up again.  
         </p>
         <p>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To tie this back into the consumption of substances and digital art media, I find that substances, for my depraved self it is alcohol and for my more vulnerable honest self psychedelics, can aid in producing these spiritual moments of raw emotion when paired with art or connection with another human being. Psychedelics can be an impactful cosmic force but the discussion of those soul-exposing substances deserves several entries dedicated to them alone. My mental state at the time which this entry is referring to, is depravity, which has its own power and effect and meaning. For myself, alcohol greatly intensifies empathetic reactions to art and connection with others, but perhaps only seemingly. Alcohol has helped me feel more innately and intensely the energy the art is expressing. The energy emanating could range from an intense aura of selfless love for others, sorrow for lost loved ones, justified rage in action, or some light form of adrenaline from intense cinematography. Tears often come to me in these moments of drunken solitude paired with some form of digital art media; sometimes they pour out from true sorrow and sometimes from happiness, relief, or courage. I am often inspired in these moments and a shift in perspective occurs. However, my altered mental paradigm usually fades away along with the chemicals in my system and my mind returns to its suppressed state of perceived powerlessness. Once again the reality of substance use is apparent. They are rarely a permanent solution to anything, but they provide a blissful escape from a suppressing reality or self-image. It has been said those with a rock-solid foundation will be secure and will withstand the coming storm, unless that rock is made of crack cocaine. However, I remain firm in my stance that substances, in the hands of those who can maintain dominance over them, can assist in producing inspiration and relief.  
         </p>
         <p>
           &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;That morning with Amanda I experienced a connection with her and the art we were absorbing, one of my new favorite films. She expressed it had been a long time since she had sat down and watched a movie. This didn't surprise me. She is an addict who could hardly sit still, like most of us, always planning our next move to strike chemical gold. She wasn't staying long and we had enough doses to carry us through the film, so she sat still and watched. The movie was titled, "On the Count of Three," a film about two friends who agreed to have one last day of absolute freedom without consequence before they ended each other's lives. I consider the film to be amasterpiece. It is intense, real, funny, emotionally stimulating, and unpredictable, but this isn't a film review. We smoked and watched. Although I had seen the movie several times, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it with her. Like most people, I enjoy sharing the art that moves me with others. If the other individual has yet to experience the art themselves it's like experiencing it again for the first time. I become empathetic with their own experience and their energy feeds into mine. We finished the movie and I ordered her an Uber to get her back to T's home. She was adamant about me calling her from jail and stated T would like to hear from me on the inside as well. She hugged me and left. I've called her a few times from here but she has yet to answer. I'm not surprised, and perhaps it is for the best.

        <h3>Journal Entry 3-March 22nd, 2023, Day 20</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After Amanda left I returned to my room to continue drinking and finish off the last few doses. I decided to tune into something lighthearted and funny to contrast the impending misery of reporting to jail later that day. I spent a few hours drinking, hitting the pipe, and watching workaholics. The more I drank and smoked the more I was removed from the reality of wasting three months of my life in a government cage. As more liquor surged through my veins and an abundant amount of crack cocaine penetrated the gray matter within my brain, I was actually looking forward to the experience. This occurrence is a demonstration of the delusional power of substance abuse; in the moment of indulgence, while one’s synaptic gaps are saturated with rewarding chemicals, the illusion is valid and relieving.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During this session of deathly indulgence, I was flooded with inspiration to make my jail experience worthwhile as I vowed to transform my body, accomplish a substantial amount of writing, study literature, and practice meditation to gain a sense of peace and control over my damaged perspective and direction. These were high expectations for a cracked-out drunk headed to jail with very few accomplishments in the past 10 years. All of these activities I seldom participated in during my routine day, even on my good days, sober or not. 
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I had one final dose left and in following sensible crack head logic, it was a doozie. The final dose should always be considerably larger than previous ones to ensure satisfaction, for as long as it could last, still fleeting of course, it is crack after all. It is perhaps the most ephemeral high there is. It leaves almost as quickly as it hits. It is the Muhammad Ali of drug experiences, it makes you float like a butterfly and stings you like a bee in almost the same instant. It catapults you high in the air with amazing velocity, but what goes up must come down, with an almost equally frightening speed, terrified of the daunting impact with hard ground, solid reality. I made sure to take a few good drinks of the Bacardi beforehand to ensure a proper mix, a good chemical cocktail. I then loaded her up, sparked, held it in for a dangerously long time and……Blast Off! I believe I had finally caught the dragon after chasing behind the elusive beast for so long.   
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My brain was instantly submerged in dopamine. At that moment I was more than content, at that moment I wouldn’t have changed anything about my life, delusion had taken full form. It was as if every decision I had made, both principled and depraved, was a result of destiny, ultimately serving me with the right flavors of experience, all necessary for fulfilling my glorified purpose to come. Riding that high, I was the master of my perspective, of my own world, completely confident in my ability to conquer my future with an iron fist. I had no doubts and no fear. A tectonic shift in perspective had occurred. I was literally looking forward to going to jail. I was occupied only by the positive outcomes of my situation. My reality was void of all negativity and the adverse consequences of my actions were not visible. I wasn’t permitted to have a license for 18-36 months, my Mustang which was just recently paid off had been totaled, my future car insurance payment would be unpayable, more criminal charges on my record, thousands in credit card debt which was mostly accrued in the past couple of months, credit demolished, and I had no guaranteed place to lay my head once released from jail. None of it existed. Ignorance was bliss behind the veil of thick chemical clouds I was soaring above. My spirit had been moved from a damp, dark basement, chained down by the consequences of my actions, to being freed to roam in the light and open spaces. In that altered reality one’s imagination can take them as far as the horizon and beyond. I was grateful for the delusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I would consider this elevated moment to be artificially spiritual. All of the parameters that I declared in a previous entry for any drug experience (omitting psychedelics) to be spiritual were present, except for a piece of external stimuli such as art or connection with another human being. Crack alone rarely serves as a catalyst for inspiration of this magnitude but I believe my desperate circumstance (and the liquor) helped fuel my experience. I consider that experience artificial due to the means by which the experience was reached; such experiences are dangerous. For I would say the experience itself was real, as real as any emotion or belief could be. With time the courage and confidence left my body along with the toxins that produced them; they were not gained by natural contemplation. Thus arises the danger. The neural networks within my brain were not, over time, consciously crafted toward that state of invincibility. They were crafted towards relying on a substance for liberation. This left me starving for more substances, to keep the illusion alive a little bit longer. 
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The normal state of the brain is much more difficult to persuade in the direction of extreme optimism and hope against the blatant limitations of the 3D reality. With practice in meditation and perhaps prayer, the brain, and therefore the mind, can be trained to see our limitations for what they are, illusions; with enough faith the body can be moved into action to achieve dreams that are of the highest frequencies, frequencies that align with the Spirit. The process of achieving such a state, without substances, requires an anchored ambition, brain training, and a controlled perspective. There are no shortcuts and the transformative beauty lies in the journey, not the destination. Lying there on my bed, zonked out of my mind, I was already there, I felt as if I had already achieved my desired state of accomplishment. It is peculiar to mention that many spiritualists claim that in order to manifest our deepest desires, we must match the frequency of what we desire; they claim we need to train our mind and body to feel as if our future goal has already come to fruition, and in effect, moving the body and universe around us to an equal vibration. As Eckhart Tolle states, “You get there by realizing you are already there.” I could go on about the nature of the subconscious and perhaps the law of attraction but I’ll save it for another time.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The fact is I reached my desired state of being through artificial means. The problem lies in it being synthetic, it doesn’t last, and it isn’t genuine. The toxins were doing the talking, not my natural state of being. It was an act of artificial spirituality. The weight of my “enlightened” thoughts were supported by an indestructible structure of dopamine, resulting in every notion becoming a prophetic revelation; knowing full well I was not any closer to my goal as my spirit became deflated, stuck with the same neural networks and doomed behavior. Thus, addiction ensues to keep the magic going. Substances may provide a burst of inspiration and aid in birthing new ideals, but without the sober grit to carry them out, they almost mean nothing. I did manage to escape the depressing facts of my circumstance that early morning; in the end that’s the only guarantee of substance consumption. It provides a break, a brief escape to a new perspective.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During the dopamine surge I was so floored with encouragement I picked up my phone and called Amanda, the girl I was with hours before. I expressed that I had just caught the dragon and I rambled on about my newfound perspective. I recklessly jumped from topic to topic, epiphany to epiphany; when one light bulb came on three more were lit simultaneously. I couldn’t catch up with my own string of thoughts. I believe I maintained some sort of linear logic, but just barely. Amanda could hardly get in a word, the poor girl. I think the general message I was expressing is as follows: “I have regrets but I intend to make them worthwhile, I will ground myself in this coming experience, I will be thankful for every incident that led me here, the longer I stare into the abyss the more blinding the light will be, the more beautiful and joyous the redemption. The deeper the darkness the brighter the light. The more hardships I endure the more thankful I’ll be for a normal, boring, and peaceful existence. Spending a few months in jail can make one ecstatic to experience routine pleasures most take for granted. The joy and relief I will experience when I leave jail a free man, with no probation and off paper for the first time in nearly two years, and having transformed my body and my mind, and having completed an extensive catalog of writings will make the time served worth it.” Well that doesn’t sound too bad does it? This is the lulling power of an intoxicated perspective.    
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After several minutes of pouring out my subconscious stream of thought into Amanda’s sore ears, I finally gave her some mercy and ended the conversation. She didn’t seem to be bothered by the whole thing. She never tried to cut me off and she confirmed that I was on to something, that I was somehow making a connection between the different lightbulbs, ultimately conveying a source of illumination. After hanging up I enjoyed the remainder of my high and killed the rest of the Bacardi. It was around 9 A.M. As my brain slowly leveled to relatively normal chemical levels I decided to attempt to fall asleep for a few hours before I had to report at FCDC at 7 P.M. I should have known better. Both the lingering stimulants in my system and the rapidly approaching afternoon kept me from falling into unconsciousness. I decided I wanted to be conscious for my final hours before heading for an extended stay at Lexington’s finest institutional shelter. My chemical dependence on exterior sources of dopamine outweighed my need for sleep and out I went to score one last time.

        <h3>Journal Entry 4-March 25th, 2023, Day 23</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Continuing from my last entry, I got up from my bed exhausted without sleep to begin making plans for some more dope. I had been sobering up for the past hour or two as I tried to sleep, morale was low. I decided to give up on sleep due to the fear of waking up in a full detox with only an hour or so left before incarceration, a grim hour that would have been. I instead decided to act and began making plans to avoid spending my first night in jail sober. For all I knew this could have been the last dragon I chased if I were to stick with my resolve to sober up once my sentence had been served.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I was hoping I could get one last cash advance off of the credit card I had been abusing. I called an Uber to pick me up with two scheduled stops, the neighborhood Kroger where I could find an approved ATM for cash advances, and my friend Breezy, in Cardinal Valley, A.K.A the hood. There was also a liquor store in the Kroger shopping center; I thirsted for the immediate liquid satisfaction of alcohol, the old familiar burn. At the moment I decided against it as my judge, who knew my tendencies as I had been in mental health court with him for nearly two years, warned me not to report intoxicated with the consequence of additional charges. 
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I considered Breezy to be another circumstance friend for the majority of our friendship, but I believe that has changed. He is, seemingly, supportive of me getting sober but it can’t be denied that I’ve only been in his presence while sober one time, the relational energy was altered, and it was somewhat awkward. Still, we had spent a lot of time together, mostly chasing and consuming drugs and alcohol. He has consistently had my back and always let me into his mother’s home when I had nowhere to go, after having to convince his mother which usually required me to bring food as some sort of offering of gratitude. I will admit my presence almost always guaranteed the accompaniment of drugs and alcohol, which I’m sure was a motivating factor in Breezy’s receptiveness towards me. We do have a bond in music, primarily hip-hop. I recall an occasion when we were high on ice and wrote lyrics for hours, sharing our lines with one another and giving feedback. Yes, at this point I consider us friends, but if I am to achieve long-term sobriety after my sentence it would be wise to keep my distance unless he too is on the same faithful path.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I had to wait on my Uber for about twenty-five minutes. The vacancy of toxins in my system and the gravity of the rapidly approaching deadline to get high continued to weigh down my spirit. Supposedly, an increase in gravitational pull on a subject accelerates the passing of time. Unfortunately, these laws of physics didn’t apply to my situation. Each successive minute dragged on longer than the previous one, an exponential increase in misery. Unlike hours before, in my current and more sober state of mind, I felt as if I was a package on a conveyor belt, moving closer to being processed, handled, shipped, and stored in some damp basement somewhere; until those that proctored me decide to make use of me again, my fate outside the reach of my own will; waiting to be shipped back into society where I can assist in keeping the economic cogs rotating in the machinery of profit and control. That conveyor belt seemed to be steadily increasing in speed in contrast to the slowly approaching Uber driver and anticipated train whistle that accompanies a large dose of crack cocaine. That which I dreaded was gaining on me and what I was racing toward was leaving me behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Finally the Uber arrived. They drove me to the Kroger just around the corner from my parent’s home and I ran inside to the ATM. A wave of anxiety rushed over me as I’ve had difficulty with cash advances in the recent past. If I couldn’t get the cash I would be left to endure this chemical deficiency. Alcohol, the only substance credit was good for, was out of the question. I recall some initial error with the ATM as a cash withdrawal option was absent. Another wave of peril washed over me. I re-inserted my card and to my sweaty relief, the credit card option was there. I selected the $80 withdrawal, tension building as the machine processed my request with alarming images of “transaction denied” flashing through my head. I was beginning to think the processing time was taking too long for a successful transaction but suddenly, bingo! The beautiful sound of cash being dispensed sedated my nerves and perhaps some pre-emptive dopamine entered my brain at the thought of a future dose. Transaction successful. I was still feeling rather low as there was no guarantee of a score, I had only completed part one of the process, but at least I was one step closer.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As I headed back to the Uber, the liquor store one hundred feet away entered my awareness along with the comforting idea of a guaranteed buzz if my efforts in Cardinal Valley were to fail. My disease began the process of making its case within my brain, justifying and manipulating my consciousness to get what it desired. Perhaps I could control my drinking enough to blow a 0.00 when reporting to FCDC. This possibility coupled with the fear of being completely sober for the rest of the day gave rise to impulsivity, which took over and before I knew it I was asking the driver to pull in front of the Kroger Wine and Spirits. It was time to get spiritual. We then made our way to Breezy’s neighborhood after buying my usual, a fifth of Bacardi clear. A sane person would have just bought 375ml as I, literally minutes before, vowed not to drink too much, similar to how minutes before that I was determined to not drink at all. If you give addiction an inch it will certainly take the full mile and beyond. That is the nature of this malady. As the A.A. big book states, alcoholics have the habit of getting tight right at the wrong moment.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I began to feel more at ease as we approached Versailles Road, the entrance to Cardinal Valley. This is another area of town where a white middle-class suburban kid like me had no business being unless that business was getting ripped. I arrived at Breezy’s apartment and followed the usual routine of tapping on his bedroom window on the side of the building. No answer. I had messaged him before I left and he replied but had remained silenced since. It was still rather early and I figured he fell back asleep. He had recently been liberated from an ankle monitor so there was a considerable chance he wasn’t home, finally freed from the immediate eyes of our mutual big brother. At this moment I was thankful I had stopped and purchased a bottle. I decided to wait on the steps, have a few drinks, and wait it out. How moronic and ironic it would have been to get arrested for drinking in public on the day I was reporting to jail. In this neighborhood I was highlighted and triple underlined; I stuck out worse than Spike Lee at a Donald Trump rally. After a few drinks, the thought of getting arrested simply amused me. The more I drank the greater the risk but the less I cared.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;About an hour had passed and many calls and texts had been sent Breezy’s way but no response. Anxious thoughts began to creep into my mind as the deadline for toxic consumption drew near but the liquor slowed their pace. Breezy generally being a middleman for the coming transaction increased my desperation to hear my phone chime or ring. I had a somewhat reliable source but that individual had recently been apprehended and currently resides in the pod directly below me. I eventually contained enough liquid courage to tap harder on his window; hard enough to wake him but not so loud that his mother could hear. She was a mostly sweet older woman but could become quite volatile when Breezy invited people into her home. Luckily, I was well enough known and had gained some mercy credit by frequently ordering hundreds of dollars worth of her favorite foods to her door when I visited in the past as a peace offering of some sort. Fortunately, he finally peered through the window. Unfortunately, he told me nobody could come in. Apparently, after being released from jail, his mom had asserted dominance over her home. Thankfully, he agreed to come out to me.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Breezy knew I had to report at 7 P.M.  By the time he joined me out front I believe it was around 2-2:30 P.M., plenty of time to score and enjoy the score itself, theoretically. The sooner the better of course, as I needed to lay off the liquor if I wanted to avoid trouble when reporting to FCDC; I was banking on the absence of a urine analysis. My goal was to be high through the always depressing processing stage of being taken prisoner and on into the majority of the night. Crack cocaine is a suitable tool for launching one’s elevation to a frightening height, but I required a cozy hang time as well. Crack certainly provides the most gravity-defying take-off but it has you hurling toward a demoralizing crash landing almost quicker than you left the atmosphere. If I took a sizeable dose in the parking of FCDC I’d be on the downswing by the time I was through the second or third set of doors. The most suitable and readily available solution was ice A.K.A methamphetamine. Some, including myself, have reported being zooted for a couple of days or more after consumption, especially if one’s tolerance is low; I hadn’t indulged in a few weeks so I knew I was sitting pretty. I asked Breezy if he could find $40 in hard and $40 in ice before my solemn trip to our mutual big brother’s estate. He informed me it would be easier to get $60 in hard and $20 in ice, or perhaps he just wanted to have a few additional doses for himself. I didn’t have a problem with that plan. Crack is about twice as expensive as meth by the gram or more. If I attempted to intake more than a half gram of ice in the time allotted with my weak tolerance I would have been testing the limits of my cardiovascular system. I handed him $60 and he departed to satisfy my request. Godspeed my friend.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I waited in the general anticipation one always finds oneself in when awaiting the delivery of drugs. The future of my dopamine levels was in the hands of another, with no real control. While waiting I called my dad to reassure him that I would be home in time to leave for FCDC as scheduled and that I probably wouldn’t be home in time to get a meal with him. In fact, I knew I wouldn’t be. I hadn’t eaten in almost 48 hours and my current schedule of stimulant consumption would extend my involuntary fast for another 24. Stimulants, especially any form of amphetamines, truly are the most effective dietary narcotics in existence, as long as your only goal is to lose weight. I felt remorseful for missing our last meal together before I became incarcerated. I felt remorseful about it even as I was writing these words and feel awful still as I’m typing up what I wrote. It’s not as if I had a long sentence and wouldn’t be able to sit down to a meal with my father in the near future, but I remain guilty.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Whenever I pick up the bottle or some other punishing substance, I am set on the path of destruction and the ones I care for most are on the front lines doing damage control. Addiction is a selfish storm of relentless strength, some perverted force of nature that human powers have little hope of combatting. This deadly cyclone can not often be thwarted by any human effort, no matter how sincere and desperate. The only option one has when such a storm is on their doorstep is to take cover and either assist in disaster recovery post mayhem, relying on some higher power to prevent another catastrophe, or move far away where the climate is less familiar and less likely to bring tragedy. Once the toxins in my system subside I am left to absorb the reciprocated energy of my actions. Only then do I witness the debris of my own demolition, with those I love dispersed among the rubble. This heinous vibrancy my mind and body can barely withstand, as the morning after my brain has become a barren wasteland, treated as a rich mine of dopamine now depleted by a horde of substances working as greedy excavators, leaving my neural receptors as dry as a desert plain.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Thus the cycle continues and the source of my misery beckons, its taunts of instant gratification and temporary relief ring loudly in my ears; soon followed by justification to indulge, and off I go again, lost to the whirlpool of chemical delusion and chaos, not knowing when it will spit me out. The meal I was supposed to have with my father before reporting to FCDC had no chance of taking place. It seems as if all the desperate repentance I’ve gone through never enacted any change.  As I impatiently waited on that front porch I was coming to the end of the longest flood of substance abuse and self-loathing I have ever endured. I just had to ride one more wave of this unabating hurricane, one final tsunami to end the storm, one last time; I have had hundreds of one last times in my life.

        <h3>Journal Entry 5-March 26th, 2023, Day 24</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As I waited for Breezy to return I witnessed undercover cops pull up to several different spots within the immediate area, on Breezy’s apartment street as well as the one running parallel, with a laundromat and parking between the two. They were putting up signs of some sort. I called Breezy to warn him to take an alternate route but he failed to answer and I started to sweat despite the cold weather. No matter how much you trust someone, there is no such thing as a guaranteed result when dealing with drugs and drug people. As Raoul Duke mentioned from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, “You can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug.” A few minutes later he came walking towards the stoop. I felt a premature rush of dopamine from the initial relief of his return and the thought of a secured dose. My dopamine receptors, the dry desert, would soon be hydrated.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Due to Breezy’s mother and her newfound strength in resisting intruders, we took to the upper stairwell to inhale some poison. It satiated my chemical thirst and I was satisfied, for a few minutes at least. I needed a comfortable and safe place to plan my next move, the endgame was here and every minute mattered. We managed to convince “momma” to let me hang out for an hour by leaning on her sympathy towards a man headed to the cage. I had refuge in his room and a warm, dry place to take a few doses. We hit the pipe and tried to find some ice. Breezy had no luck and neither did I until I hit up an acquaintance named Gage, whom I didn’t even consider to be a circumstance friend at the time for reasons I may discuss in a later entry. I am amused that Gage is my current bunkie in FCDC and I’ve been locked up with him for the past few weeks. I suppose I’d consider him a friend as of now and he still pinches my nerves but for reasons less offensive than my previous complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Gage did not pick up his phone, as he was already in jail. A female I did not know answered and informed me that this was no longer Gage’s phone, but she knew him. Influenced by desperation and confidence in the genre of company Gage kept, I asked this stranger if she knew where I could get a $20 bag of ice, despite the assumption that she stole Gage’s phone and could be responsible for his incarceration. To my luck, but not to my surprise, she confirmed that she could serve me. All I had to do was make my way to the marathon off of Eastland and New Circle. As sketchy as this situation seemed I was mostly comfortable with it. There aren’t many who would aim to rip someone off over $20. I immediately ordered an Uber, took one more dose, and left the remainder of the Bacardi to Breezy as a parting gift. I wasn’t safe with it in my possession.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Fortunately, my Uber driver was not judgemental or concerned about taking me to a potential drug deal. It was fairly obvious considering I called the girl, whatever her name was, to validate the location and time. My driver even assisted in confirming the correct gas station where she was located. I recall fabricating some lie as to why I was meeting “my friend” at a gas station, instead of her home, just to be on the safe side. She asked a couple of questions and offered to take me to her home instead of the gas station as my lie inferred that she lived just around the corner. I quickly forged some new facts, such as her boyfriend being home and having a distaste for my presence. Living in a world of addiction and vice leads one to obtain a sense of covertness and misdirection. Most of us become excellent liars and forgers of false personalities and characteristics, to suit the situation and present company to our needs. I’ve always thought I would make a good spy, especially if my cover identity is an alcoholic or junkie. This is probably just one of many delusions I have of myself and my Uber driver probably knew what was up.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I managed to establish a single-serving friendship with her, as Tyler Durden from “Fight Club” would say, after being transparent with my current legal situation, establishing some openness and vulnerability. In addition to concocting personal propaganda, I have also adopted the capability of establishing connections with any character that might cross my path. This includes a colorful array of peculiar personalities often found in rugged environments; I’ve learned to make fast friends with individuals I’d normally never even come in contact with according to my more natural habitat. I feel right at home in rehabilitation centers and jail cells. Imagine the adaptation required of a middle-class, Christian kid with social anxiety in his days of grade school, feeling awkward and out of place and burdened with the grueling task of small talk in rooms full of peers with similar backgrounds, to waltzing into a drug den with guns on the table and being the only white person in the room, and feeling perfectly comfortable as he did it. That kid is me. It actually feels natural to me now, just being myself in environments that breed distrust for someone who looks like me. I barely try to blend in. I’m just Isaac, your polite, friendly neighborhood white guy, except I’m not from the neighborhood. I’ve learned to be genuine in trying to connect with people. My strategy is to make it hard for people to dislike me by being honest and deflating my ego. I’ve learned how to make harboring a distaste for my presence a difficult chore and the transition from stranger to ally as smooth as can be. Of course in the drug world, generosity goes a long way. Drugs are a relational catalyst that tend to sew the varying threads of society together. Whether you’re actively using or in recovery, you’ll be surrounded by your own kind. It doesn’t matter who you were born to be before you started your journey with substances, you’re a drug person now, an addict, an alcoholic, in active recovery or not.    
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Reporting to jail intoxicated became a brief subject of conversation with my Uber driver and she, as well as my judge, confirmed that I would receive a criminal charge if I were to do so. A sense of regret wafted over me but was brushed to the back of my mind as the stress of my current objective remained dominant. I was calling Gage’s phone again before I exited the minivan. No answer. Oh boy, here we go, I thought. I walked around and inside the marathon to no avail. I was looking for a woman who should have been looking for me. I didn’t know if she was already here, with someone else, working in the store, in her car, on her way, ignoring me, or had been detained. My phone had around 10%-5% of battery life and I became anxious that my efforts had become fruitless. It should have been quite obvious that I was her sting with the frantic nature of my pacing, calling, and searching the immediate area. The third time I called her she knocked on the window from inside the store behind me, pointed to herself, and nodded. For her to make such a confident gesture I must have choreographed my role as buyer as blatantly as I had hoped. I replied with a thumbs up and an inner sigh of relief. She had a large birthmark on her face and in describing this person to Gage about a week later he told me the story of his legal demise and that she was involved. He also informed me she was the cousin of a girl I thought, due to severely intoxicated delusion, I was in love with; that girl, Sam, is also in the same jail where I reside as I write this. The universe is screaming for me to wake up.   
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The one serving me, Samantha’s cousin, brought me to the door of her van and told me to grab the product on the seat and leave the $20 in its place. She told me to hit her up and went back into the store. Score successful, a three-pointer buzzer beater as the time I had left before I had to report was waning. She said to hit her up and went back into the store. The volume of the bag exceeded my expectations, a full gram. I just hoped it was real product and fentanyl free. The paranoia of just completing an open drug deal without immediately having a ride out of the vicinity began to set in. I left the marathon and headed to Richie’s fried chicken next door. The inside was closed. I stood out front and attempted to order an Uber and to my slight shock and dread, there were no drivers available. I was sure it was due to the arriving storm with gusts brewing up a potential tornado. At this time it was about 3:30 P.M., clock ticking. Dark storm clouds were on the horizon, foreshadowing my mental state for the next few days at least, perhaps for much longer. If I could get home with ample time before I had to report, I could stall the unforgiving typhoon of mental anguish for a little longer, the coward that I am. Take any addict in active addiction and I can almost guarantee they’d do the same  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t like standing openly in front of Richie’s while carrying illicit substances, so I made my way to the Office Lounge, a bar just around the corner. Still no Uber or Lyft drivers available. I considered calling my parents for a ride but decided to wait it out a little longer as I was fairly safe on time. As an alcoholic, it was impossible to not contemplate a drink as I stood in front of a bar with no purpose other than to patiently wait. I will not order a drink, I told myself, with it nearing 4 P.M. The storm had arrived with those dark clouds now releasing their weight, producing a heavy curtain of rain. Still no drivers. I will not order a drink. I was reluctant to ask my parents for a ride as they would have had to drive across town in inclement weather, reducing my precious free time; part of me didn’t want to bother them but a larger portion was more concerned with my dwindling time to consume ice and the fact I would have to convince them to stop at a head shop so I could purchase a chicken bone, an obstacle I’d rather not face. I checked my phone again and still, no drivers available. No drinks, I begged myself. I went to ask the bartender if I could wait on the patio for my Uber so I wouldn’t be loitering without permission; she said of course. Soon I would be forced to call my parents, my phone was basically dead and even if I did hail a driver my phone dying before they got here would complicate the process. I was pleading for an available driver nearby, to proceed with my selfish program without difficulty. To my relief, one finally accepted my trip request but they were a solid twenty minutes out. My phone was dangerously close to dying, I had to sweat it out for a bit longer, but the end was in sight.    
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The impulse to buy a drink struck me again and it was met with justification, a dangerous combination of weaponry in the arsenal of most alcoholics; an alcoholic justifying a drink is an oxymoron that could only withstand reason in apocalyptic conditions, and probably not even then. Impulse and justification are often the axles on which the train of intoxicated chaos is supported. Ordering a beer at the Office Lounge was more impulse than justification. I was carried by the relief of finding a driver and the concern over my phone dying before they got here to the bar and ordered a strong IPA to celebrate and curb the anxiety over my nearly depleted battery. This variety of self-serving rationale, which had the illusion of logic, has led to drinking and using more times than I’d care to admit. The will of my higher consciousness has built a seemingly impenetrable barricade along the neural networks that lead to a drink or drug, preventing those destructive neurons from firing; time after time those defenses have been breached by the brute force of impulse, usually strengthened by an emotional response to stimuli and the cleverness of my disease. My mind’s favorite fallacy to follow is that I needed one last drink, one last use, as if a final epic blowout would satisfy my endless thirst and silence my constant craving once and for all. This rhetoric was at play at this moment as well, one last brew to send me off on yet another journey of sobriety. I have had hundreds of “one last drink and drug use” scenarios. The mental barricade against poor decision-making stood no chance on that day as it was already permeated by former drinks and doses. I bought the beer, chugged it down, and went out to wait for my ride, slightly more at ease.

        <h3>Journal Entry 6-March 27th, 2023, Day 25</h3>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Uber arrived with my phone still alive. We made our way to a head shop where I purchased a chicken bone with water filtration, a meth bubbler, and then we headed for my parent’s house. I ended up having an uplifting conversation with the driver and was once again open with my current legal situation, which the alcohol and drugs encouraged. The only minor obstacle left to overcome in the pursuit of getting zooted before jail was getting past my parents with the glassware without them making too much of a fuss. I figured I could get away with just about anything as long as I was home and ready to head to FCDC when the time came. My dad let me in and I told him it was glass in the brown paper bag without supplying additional details of its purpose, hoping he would assume it was for cannabis consumption. They weren’t aware that I had an occasional habit of smoking meth.
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I made it to my room, dropped off the goods, and then walked into my parent’s room to borrow the phone charger. My mom asked me what was in the bag that I brought in and I told her it was a bowl I was going to smoke weed out of. She of course wasn’t pleased with me smoking weed in my room but they had let it slide for years, only occasionally becoming frustrated by the aroma of “pot” in my room, as they often called it. I knew there would be little protest this time, lest I get triggered and head out of the house so close to our departure time. I retreated into my room and began loading up both rigs, the crack pipe and the bubbler. I recall being continually interrupted by one of my parents summoning me out of my room to inquire about something that could be saved for the car ride. I was desperate for uninterrupted solace in my room up until we departed. I informed them both that for the next couple of hours, I would be in my room, alone and uninterrupted; they acknowledged and thankfully understood.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I was once again in my sanctuary to enjoy my final moments of solitude for the next few months. This would be a time of introspection and reflection for someone who isn’t under heavy influence, but I was simply trying to escape reality. I first hit the crack pipe a couple of times to get rid of what I had left and then proceeded to begin smoking a considerable amount of meth. I had queued up Netflix, sat back, smoked, and watched TV up until I had to leave. I also took advantage of my alone time by pleasuring myself, which is a common habit of meth users after indulging. Amphetamines increase sexual stimulation and I knew I was about to be stuck in a pod with 12 other men for 3 months so I gave in to my pathetic need for release in private while I still could. I recall my parents saying we were to leave at 5:30 P.M., an hour before it was necessary to leave, as they were headed to a church service after dropping me off. Myself, desperate to savor every last minute of freedom and meth consumption, scheduled an Uber to pick me up at about 6:15 P.M. They weren’t happy about it, and as untrusting of me as they were they agreed to leave at the time of my choosing to ensure I got there on time. As is routine, my selfish program derailed my family’s plan.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I waited until the last possible second to put on several layers of white t-shirts, boxers, and socks; a necessary process for one who wanted to bring in clothes to jail. I was cutting it a little close for my parent’s liking. I was so desperate to fully enjoy my final ice session I even called FCDC and asked if it was acceptable to report the next morning due to inclement weather and claimed there weren’t any Uber drivers available to take me which could have been true, it was a nasty storm. Their response was less than assuring so I decided to stick with 7:00 P.M., one of the few wise decisions I had made in the past couple of months.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am genuinely surprised, as high as I was, that I refrained from concocting some elaborate scheme or fable that would have allowed me to put off serving my sentence or just bailing altogether. I suppose it was some final shred of humanity left in me that had love for my parents and didn’t want to cause them any more suffering and frustration, although it didn’t often cease my recklessness in the past. They had spent $3000 to pay for my lawyer to score the legal deal I had, plus the $2500 they used to bail me out so I could spend some time at home and get some affairs in order before I had to serve; the bailout took a lot of convincing and I had to pull out the most desperate of performances to assure them it was the right thing to do. I convinced them I wouldn’t drink upon being released but that was surely my intent. It was true I needed to get some financial issues dealt with and a haircut would be nice before serving three months but that was not my core motivation for getting bailed out. My objective was to be sober when I was released from serving my full sentence but having woken up in jail with my life again fallen apart, planted the seed of indulgence in my brain and there was no disposing of it. I honestly thought I had to get bailed out and “drink about it”, once again believing I could purge my craving once and for all. I justified this blatant manipulation of my parents with the conclusion that I wouldn’t be able to not pick up a drink upon release if I couldn’t serve my selfish need before my sentence was complete. The fact they would get their $2500 back after the case was closed also helped influence my faulty sense of morality. I also believed I could immediately pay them back with a series of cash advances from my credit card, but that proved to be mostly false. I am thankful that even in my most depraved state I did not throw my parent’s sympathy and money back in their face and decided to report on time.  
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I don’t recall being depressed or even distressed when I was preparing to leave. The substances had done their job and would keep doing it for a generous amount of time. I had adopted the same energy I had early that morning, where I was almost excited to begin my sentence, be productive with writing and exercise, and start a new life on the other side of it all. The warm veil of toxicity had granted me delusion once again, but the fact that you are reading this is proof my ambitions weren’t completely false. I was higher than a tweaker attempting to install a cordless phone by the time we left. I never exhibited the mannerisms that accompanied the common tweaker when high on ice but I never considered myself a meth head. I had picked up the habit of occasional meth consumption over the past couple of years but it never became a weekly or even a bi-weekly occurrence. I almost always took the first hit of meth while already under the influence of alcohol. For myself, alcohol has always been the catalyst for hard drug use and destructive behavior. I assume the unforgiving poison would have eventually warped my neural structure to the point of constant paranoia and an absent attention span. My parents had never been able to call me out when I was on stimulants, but it usually became obvious after about a fifth of hard liquor. They didn’t accuse me of being on anything on the ride over to FCDC. Even if they did, what would be the point of accusations at this point?
        </p>
        <p>
          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During the trip, I was playing music and hitting my vape as much as possible, taking advantage of my freedom while it remained intact. The storm was in full force at this point with heavy rain pelting the windshield and strong gusts rocking the car. A tree had fallen on the opposite side of the road, backing up traffic for at least a mile. I was moving from a dark and hazardous environment into an even darker and depressing cage. I would soon have the most secure shelter in the county, but I’d prefer to be cold and naked in the storm, as would most. At this moment I was thankful for the copious amount of dopamine pumping through my brain, defending me from the onslaught of my grim reality. My parents were stressed due to the difficult driving conditions and heavy traffic, they were worried we weren’t going to make it on time. Even in my numbed state of euphoria, I felt guilt and remorse for continually causing them torment. I had been testing their love and the limits of the word unconditional for the past ten years. Enough was enough, I had to do better, for them if not for myself.

          &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We arrived about twenty minutes early. I was to play one last song before I went in, Godspeed/Perfect Circle by Mac Miller. I had hoped the lyrics in the track where he expressed acknowledgment of his addiction and his idealism of heaven would strike a nerve in my parents as they did in me. But I could tell they were too anxious to turn me over. I told them I could take it from here and go in on my own but they were determined to see me off all the way to the door, safe and secure in the hands of the government, definitely secure, but perhaps not safe. We walked around the building, the high winds were giving it all they had. I enjoyed the last bit of weather I’d be experiencing for three months. A family was waiting outside the door when we arrived. They were most likely immigrants or perhaps refugees from Africa based on their accents and clothing. They were seeing off their father to serve a sentence at this fine establishment. I’m sure this is a distorted image of the American dream they had in mind when moving their family here. After I hit the buzzer and waited several minutes my parents departed and we exchanged statements of loving intent. The door finally opened. I took one last hefty hit off of my vape and went inside. It was done—time to serve.
